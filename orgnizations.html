        <p class="ex">
          Oceana is a really big group that cares a lot about protecting the oceans and the life inside them. It started in 2001 and has won many fights to help marine animals and their homes. They work to stop things like pollution from oil and other sources, and they also want to protect special places in the oceans like the Arctic and different islands. They do a lot to keep the oceans safe and clean.      </p>

        <p class="ex">
          The Monterey Bay Aquarium is a special place that shows off the amazing life in the ocean. It also works hard to protect marine animals and their homes. The aquarium helps save animals like sea otters and white sharks. They talk about important ocean problems locally and internationally. They also study sharks, tuna, and sea otters to understand how to keep them safe. Plus, they teach people and businesses how to choose seafood that doesn't harm the ocean.

        <h3 class="organiztion_name">Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</h3>
        <p class="ex">
          This group deserves recognition while being fairly contentious. The Earth Force Society was established in 1977 by Paul Watson, a former Greenpeace member, and is now most known for interfering with Japanese whaling operations in the Southern Ocean. In order to preserve and safeguard ecosystems and species, Sea Shepherd seeks to put an end to the habitat damage and animal killing that occurs throughout the world's oceans. They employ cutting-edge direct-action non-lethal techniques, such as scuttling and immobilizing whaling vessels, interfering with seal hunts, and hurling bottles of pungent butyric acid against whaling vessels at sea, among others.

        </h3>
    
        <p class="ex">
          A multinational organization called Greenpeace uses non-violent creative action to combat environmental crimes. The organization's principal objectives are to save all types of biodiversity, stop pollution and abuse of the oceans, land, air, and fresh water on the planet, put an end to nuclear dangers, and advance world peace, disarmament, and nonviolence. The group works on a number of issues specifically related to the marine environment. Greenpeace urges large firms to lessen their plastic impact in order to stop the flow of plastic into our oceans through its extensive global networks. The organization also works to address climate change, ocean acidification, and unsustainable industrial fishing methods.
